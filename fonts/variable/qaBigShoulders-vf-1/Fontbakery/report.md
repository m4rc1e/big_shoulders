<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Checking file is named canonically.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/canonical_filename](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/canonical_filename)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s filename must be composed in the following manner:
&lt;familyname&gt;-&lt;stylename&gt;.ttf

- Nunito-Regular.ttf,
- Oswald-BoldItalic.ttf

Variable fonts must list the axis tags in alphabetical order in square brackets
and separated by commas:

- Roboto[wdth,wght].ttf
- Familyname-Italic[wght].ttf


</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** font filename "Big_Shoulders[opsz,wght].ttf" is invalid. It must not contain underscore characters! [code: invalid-char]

* üî• **FAIL** TYPOGRAPHIC_SUBFAMILY_NAME for Win "Text Thin" is incorrect. It must be "Thin". [code: bad-typo-win]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Ensure VFs do not contain opsz or ital axes. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/unsupported_axes)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The &#x27;ital&#x27; axis is not supported yet in Google Chrome. The &#x27;opsz&#x27; axis also has
patchy support.

For the time being, we need to ensure that VFs do not contain either of these
axes. Once browser support is better, we can deprecate this check.

For more info regarding ital and opsz browser support, see:

</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** The "opsz" axis is not yet well supported on Google Chrome. [code: unsupported-opsz]

* ‚ö† **WARN** Thin:100 is OK on TTFs, but OTF files with those values will cause bluring on Windows. GlyphsApp users must set an Instance Custom Parameter for the Thin and ExtraLight styles to 250 and 275, so that if OTFs are exported then it will not blur on Windows. [code: blur-on-windows]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + l
	- l + f
	- i + l

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Combined length of family and style must not exceed 27 characters.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/family_and_style_max_length](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/family_and_style_max_length)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The combined length of family and style exceeds 27 chars in the following 'WINDOWS' entries:
 FONT_FAMILY_NAME = 'Big Shoulders Text Thin' / SUBFAMILY_NAME = 'Regular'

Please take a look at the conversation at https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2179 in order to understand the reasoning behind these name table records max-length criteria. [code: too-long]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Check mark characters are in GDEF mark glyph class)</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/gdef_spacing_marks](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/gdef.html#com.google.fonts/check/gdef_spacing_marks)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class should be non-spacing.
Spacing glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class may have incorrect
anchor positioning that was only intended for building composite glyphs
during design.


</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The following spacing glyphs may be in the GDEF mark glyph class by mistake:
	 acutecomb, dotbelowcomb, gravecomb, hookabovecomb, tildecomb, uni0302, uni03020300, uni03020301, uni03020303, uni03020309 and 23 more. [code: spacing-mark-glyphs]

Mark characters should be in the GDEF mark glyph class.
