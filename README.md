added case-sensitive diacriticsâ€”this means uppercase and small caps forms have vertically shorter diacritics so that you can stack lines of uppercase tighter and keep an even line

added a full set of small caps, including all diacritics & punctuation

added .sinf and .sups (scientific inferiors and superscript)

tweaked angled accents (grave, acute, double grave, Hungarian umlaut, circumflex, ) to be steeper and shorter so that lowercase characters can pack tighter together.
